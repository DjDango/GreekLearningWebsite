    <h1>Articles in greek</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>In greek we have a LOT of articles and 5 cases: Nominative, accusative, genitive, vocative and dative. 
    We'll begin with nomiative, nominative is a noun that is the subject of a sentence. There are definitive and indefinitive articles in greek
    with 3 genders: Masculine, feminine & neuter.

    <h2>Masculine, feminine & neuter nominative articles</h2>
    <p>Let's begin immediately, the definite article in english is 'the' and indefinite: 'a' or 'an'. The masculine def. nom. article 
    in greek is 'Ο' in lowercase it's: 'ο', the feminine one is: 'Η' in lowercase: 'η' and for neuter: 'Το' in lowercase: 'το'.</p>
