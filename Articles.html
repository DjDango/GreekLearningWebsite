    <h1>Articles in greek</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>In greek we have a LOT of articles and 4 cases: Nominative, accusative, genitive and vocative. 
    We'll begin with nomiνative, you use nominative when something or someone is the subject of a sentence. There are definitive and indefinitive articles in greek
    with 3 genders: Masculine, feminine & neuter.
